# 🗺️ Four-Colour Map Theorem Solver 🎨

## 🌟 Summary

Welcome to the Four-Colour Map Theorem Solver, an interactive web application demonstrating one of mathematics's most significant theorems in graph theory and topology. This tool provides a practical implementation of the Four-Colour Theorem, which states that any planar map can be coloured using no more than four colours while ensuring that no adjacent regions share the same colour, through an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

Initially developed collaboratively during the **DevelopEd 2.0 Hackathon (2023)** 🏆 and further advanced 🚀. Our implementation allows users to:
- Create custom maps through an interactive canvas
- Automatically generate mathematically valid four-colour solutions
- Save and download colored maps
- Visualize the theorem's practical applications
